# Vehicle Detection

The report for the project can be found in writeup.md.

To see the resulting detection  with the parameters selected, run parameters.py (will need the datasets).

To generate the video run video.py.

Re-submission notes:
In order to improve false detections and improve the detection of the white car, I have followed the advice from the reviewer: augment data by training over cars and not-cars extracted from the video in the sensitive areas. The quality has improved significantly. 

The new video can be found here
